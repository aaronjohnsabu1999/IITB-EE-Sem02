Character = A heritable feature that varies among individuals, such as flower color
Trait = Each variant for a character, such as purple or white color for flowers

Heritable traits = Phenotypic characters that passes from parent to offspring, e.g. eye and hair color 

Advantages of using pea plants - Availability in many varieties, Short generation time, Large number of offspring from single mating, Easier crossing due to well-separated pollen producing and egg bearing organs

Genotype = An organism's full hereditary information
Phenotype = Actual observed properties

Gene = Mendel’s “heritable factor” = Sequence of nucleotides at a specific place, locus, along a particular chromosome
Alleles = Alternative variations of a gene inherited from both the parents

Heterozygous = Having different alleles for a single trait
Homozygous = Identical alleles for a single trait

True-breeding varieties = Varieties that, over many generations of self-pollination, had produced only the same variety as the parent plant
Testcross = Breeding an organism of unknown genotype with a recessive homozygote
Monohybrids = Heterozygous for the one particular character being followed in the cross

Hybridization = Cross-pollination, mating or crossing of two true-breeding but contrasting varieties, for example, purple-flowered plants and white-flowered plants
P generation = Parental generation = The true-breeding parents
F1 generation = Filial 1 generation = Hybrid offspring

Blending hypothesis = Genetic material contributed by the two parents mixes just as blue and yellow paints blend to make green
Particulate hypothesis = Genes can be shuffled & passed along generation after generation

Law of segregation =  The two alleles for a heritable character segregate (separate from each other) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes
Law of independent assortment = Each pair of alleles segregates independently of each other pair of alleles during gamete formation (applies only to genes / allele pairs located on different chromosomes — i.e., on chromosomes that are not homologous or very far apart on the same chromosome)
Law of dominance = Some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the effect of the dominant allele

Complete dominance = Phenotypes of the heterozygote and dominant homozygote are identical
Incomplete dominance = The phenotype of F1 hybrids is somewhere between the phenotypes of the two parental varieties (Red Snapdragons)
Co-dominance = Two dominant alleles affect the phenotype in separate and distinguishable ways (ABO Blood Grouping)

Chromosome theory of inheritance = Genes are located on chromosomes and behavior of chromosomes during meiosis accounts for Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment

Sex-linked Traits and Disorders - Red-green colour blindness, Haemophilia, Night blindness, Duchenne muscular dystrophy

Genetic Recombination = The production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either P generation parent = Exchange of nucleotide sequences between two homologous DNA molecules (identical or nearly identical to one another)
Crossing over = Process in which a set of proteins conducts the exchange of corresponding segments of two non-sister chromatids

Transformation = change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA by a cell

DNA - Two anti-parallel strands, noncovalently attached to each other; semi-conservative in replications
Erwin Chargaff’s rule - %A = %T and %G = %C

Plasmids = Extra-chromosomal molecules of DNA that vary in size from 1 kb to more than 200 kb - Double stranded, covalently closed, circular molecules found in wide variety of bacterial species - Behave as accessory genetic units that replicate and inherit independently of the bacterial chromosome
Cloning vector = DNA molecule that can carry foreign DNA into a host cell and replicate there
pBR322 = Commonly used plasmid cloning vector in E. coli - Contains the origin of replication and unique restriction sites - Also contains the genes for resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline

Restriction enzyme = Restriction endonculease - Cuts DNA molecules at a specific location - Recognizes a particular short DNA sequence (restriction site) and cuts both DNA strands at precise points within this restriction site - Usually recognizes sequences containing 4-8 nucleotide pairs, which yields a set of restriction fragments

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis - A gel made of polymer acts as a molecular sieve which separates nucleic acids based on electrical charge - Negative charged DNA molecules move toward positive electrode - DNA-binding dye is mixed, which fluoresces pink in UV light - Each pink band corresponds to DNA molecules

Gene cloning - To amplify a particular gene, To produce a protein product

Primer = Short strand of nucleotides (about 18-28 nucleotides in length) that serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis - Should not be self-complimentary - 50-60% GC composition - Have a balanced distribution of G/C and A/T domains - No long strings of a single base (<4)
Tm = (A+T)*2 + (G+C)*4
